[Planning Application](https://www3.threerivers.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents\&keyVal=SOZJG0QFMG000)

## DEADLINE TO RESPOND IS 11 FEBRUARY!

### **Submit Objections Based on Planning Grounds**

- **Focus on valid planning reasons** rather than personal objections. These include:
  - **Environmental Impact**: Highlight potential harm to wildlife, biodiversity, and natural habitats.
  - **Infrastructure Pressure**: Emphasize the strain on local roads, schools, healthcare, and utilities.
  - **Flood Risk**: If applicable, argue that the development increases flood risks.
  - **Green Belt Protection**: Argue that the proposal does not meet "exceptional circumstances" required to build on green belt land.
  - **Traffic and Pollution**: Raise concerns about increased congestion and air/noise pollution.
  - **Local Character**: Demonstrate how the development is out of character with the surrounding area.
    We need as many formal objections as possible during the public consultation period as possible otherwise this may go through.
